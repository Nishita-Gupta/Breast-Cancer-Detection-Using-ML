# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“„ 1. Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women globally. Early detection and accurate diagnosis play a crucial role in increasing survival rates. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to detect breast cancer using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**. By training classification models such as XGBoost, we aim to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from cell nuclei.

## ðŸ“Š 2. Choosing the Right Dataset

We used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. This dataset contains 569 instances with 30 numerical features, each representing various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image of a breast mass.

- **Target Classes**: 
  - 0 â†’ Malignant
  - 1 â†’ Benign
- **Features**:
  - Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

You can also load it directly using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`.
